Started working on this app for a boxing gym I've been with for 5 years. Coach tracks members using pen and paper method, which for him works... however it could be improved in multiple ways.

Planning to work on this throughout the school year to create a centralized website to allow for managing of most aspects of the gym such as

<ul>
  <li>integration with instagram for social interaction</li>
  <li>link to Boxing Ontario's website to keep track of tournaments</li>
  <li>and most importantly:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>full stack app to keep track of all members and their statuses of the gym</li>
    <ul>
    <li>notify the owner of memberships that are about to expire</li>
    <li>allow for statistics to track the flow of membership renewals/purchases</li>
    <li>allow for the posting of notes in case a membership needs to be put on hold or misc info</li>
    <li>allow for the owner to sign up new members using an online form</li>
      <li>allow owner to update members based on current month renewal plans</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
</br>
Current status as of Summer 2019  
<ul>
<li>MongoDB linked to app and model has been created</li>
<li>CRUD operations written, awaiting testing</li>
<li>Basics of the site has been created</li>
<li>Need to figure out how to get the Modal working properly to allow for sign up of members</li>
</ul>
